1. Description of the code

In this code, a UDP socket is created using socket.socket() with the socket.AF_INET and socket.SOCK_DGRAM parameters to establish a UDP connection. The sendto() method is used to send file data to the target client or multiple clients.

The send_file() function sends the file to a single client and calculates the end-to-end latency by recording the start and end times of the transmission. The visualize_file() function is a placeholder for visualizing the received file on the client side.

The broadcast_file() function allows broadcasting the file to multiple clients by iterating over the list of client IP addresses and sending the file data to each client.

Finally, in the main() function, the user is prompted for the file path, target IP address, and port number. The file is sent to the target client, and its latency is calculated. The file is then visualized on the client side. Additionally, the user is asked for the number of clients to broadcast the file, and their IP addresses are collected. The file is then broadcasted to those clients.

2. Description of Wireshark images

In the wireshark, we were able to get all the data about UDP test by writing UDP keyword in the searchbar. So, we get all the information like timeout, ip address, length and etc. At the bottom of the wireshark, we can individually find those data so that they are readable and easy to understand.

3. Description of Cisco packet tracer practice

In the UDP test, firstly, we have to go to server0 and start the VM management. Second step is opening the command prompt of server0. Next, we have to start VM management in server1 so that server0 should start receiving messages from server1. Finally, we upload UDP test to server1 and restart the VMs one more time so that the server0 should show us different message.
